Introduction

Welcome to the "DSA with C Programming" repository! ðŸš€
This is a place for students to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language. Whether you're just starting or already have some knowledge, this repository will help you understand DSA with easy-to-follow examples and explanations.

Why Learn DSA?
Learning DSA is important because:

It helps you solve problems more efficiently.
It is essential for coding interviews at top tech companies.
It makes your coding smarter and faster.
By the end of this repository, you'll be able to solve problems confidently and be well-prepared for job interviews.
